Overview
This Java application combines two main functionalities: a Web Browser and an OS Installer. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing components to interact with these features.

Features

1. Web Browser Tab:
   - Allows navigation to web pages via a text field and buttons.
   - Supports navigation history (Back and Forward buttons).
   - Displays web pages using `JEditorPane` with `text/html` content type.
   - Handles hyperlinks within pages using `HyperlinkListener`.

2. OS Installer Tab:
   - Enables the user to select an ISO file for a simulated OS installation process.
   - Displays status messages during the installation process.
   - Simulates the creation of a bootable USB drive.

3. Common Components:
   - `JTextField` for email input.
   - `JPasswordField` for email password input.

Usage

1. Web Browser Tab:
   - Enter a URL in the text field and press `GO` or hit `Enter` to navigate to the page.
   - Navigation history is managed by `Back` and `Forward` buttons.

2. OS Installer Tab:
   - Click `OPEN ISO` to choose an ISO file for installation simulation.
   - Status messages indicate the progress of the installation process.

Dependencies

- Java Swing for GUI components.
- Java Standard Library for file handling (`JFileChooser`) and networking (`URL`, `URLConnection`).

Installation

1. Requirements:
   - Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

2. Execution:
   - Compile and run the `CombinedApp.java` file.
   - Ensure all dependencies are available in the classpath.

How to Run

1. Compile the Java file:
   ```
   javac CombinedApp.java
   ```

2. Run the compiled application:
   ```
   java CombinedApp
   ```

Notes

- Ensure an active internet connection for the Web Browser functionality.
- The OS Installer functionality is simulated and does not perform actual OS installations.
- Handle exceptions and errors gracefully, displaying relevant messages to the user or logging them as needed.
